	<br/><br/>	
Trained as a mathematician, I’ve always loved the process of problem solving and understanding challenging questions. I was drawn into epidemiology as an opportunity to apply my skills to important questions in population health. I believe that everyone deserves access to the resources needed to live a healthful life, but, unfortunately, due to a host of political, societal, and structural barriers, deep inequities exist. Unraveling the ways in which these forces contribute to and often worsen inequities is key to reducing inequality and improving the health of those most marginalized. This is where I’m driven to contribute; my ultimate goal is to provide the evidence needed to inform policies and programs with the ability to reduce health disparities.

My second passion is teaching. I love distilling complicated concepts into easy-to-understand pieces and facilitating moments of “ah-ha.” Catering to a diverse range of learning styles, prior background knowledge, and motivation can be challenging, but also deeply rewarding. I find that teaching epi concepts from the ground up forces me to revisit and understand them in new ways, and ultimately deepens my own understanding and makes me a better epidemiologist. 
		<br/><br/>
I expect to graduate with my PhD in the spring of 2024 and am open to the next opportunity!
