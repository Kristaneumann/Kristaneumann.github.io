 	Manage a team of 5 graduate student instructors including assigning duties, team building, and conflict resolution; assist in writing course exams and assignments;  prepare course website and materials prior to semester start; lead weekly class discussion section; host office hours and responded to student questions. <br/>
		
		In Fall 2021, I recieved the Outstanding Granduate Student Instructor Award. Throughout the semester attendance in my section increased, with student evaluations earning me an instructor score of 6.61/7 (with 143 students completing evaluations). Specific feedback from students included the following annoymous quotes:
		<ul style=“list-style-type:disc”>
			<li><em>During lab, Krista Neumann was so thorough in explaining concepts and broke down concept materials step by step so concepts were easier to understand. She is a star GSI – she really cares about students understanding materials and succeeding.”</em></li> 
			<li><em>“Krista is a very effective teacher and GSI. She really cares about whether her students are understanding the concepts, and is always happy to stop and explain things further in different ways to ensure comprehension. She made section engaging by teaching with quizzes and practice problems, on top of just lecturing. She was very effective at reaching students with different learning styles and section was always a hugely helpful time for me to make sure I understood the concepts from the previous week.”</em></li> 
			<li><em>"I could not have been more pleased to have Krista as my GSI. She tried her best with humor and games to keep the class engaged for the two hours. I appreciated that she would sometimes add extra bits of information to the slide deck so we would have some more context and practice problems. With regards to one–on–one office hours, I was very impressed that she took the time to prepare for our meeting and that she made herself available to ask questions about the program in general and how to navigate graduate school.”</em></li>
